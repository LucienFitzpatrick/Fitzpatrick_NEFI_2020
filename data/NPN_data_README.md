# **Arb_Quercus_NPN_data_leaves_CLEAN_individual.csv**

The leaf.clean and color.clean values are calculated by checking our raw "Yes" observations and making sure that either the previous or future value also has a "Yes". This is in case of misentered values becasue if a tree was said to have leaves one observations without previous or future observations also seeing leaves it is assumed a mistake.
